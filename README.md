# Streamlining-Ticket-Assignment-for-Efficient-Support-Operations
📖 Project Overview

At ABC Corporation, the rapid growth of support requests highlighted the need for an automated ticket management system. Manual ticket assignment often caused delays, misrouting, and unbalanced workloads.

This project implements an automated ticket assignment system in ServiceNow, ensuring tickets are routed to the correct team without manual intervention.

🎯 Objectives

Automate ticket routing for timely and accurate assignment.

Minimize delays and errors caused by manual intervention.

Enhance customer satisfaction through faster response times.

Optimize team resources with balanced workloads.

Increase transparency with clear assignment logic and reporting.

✨ Key Features

Automated Routing – Tickets instantly go to the right team.

Dynamic Rules – Configurable logic based on category or priority.

Load Balancing – Even distribution of workload across teams.

Escalation Support – Auto-escalation for tickets nearing SLA breaches.

Real-time Notifications – Alerts for quicker response.

Analytics & Reporting – Insights into ticket flow and team performance.

⚙️ ServiceNow Developer Setup

Create a free developer account at the ServiceNow Developer Portal
.

Verify your email and log in.

Request a Personal Developer Instance (PDI).

Use Creator Studio/App Engine Studio to build and configure the application.

🛠️ Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Creating Users

Users represent individuals in the system:

Katherine Pierce – Member of the Certificates Group.

Manne Niranjan – Member of the Platform Group.

2️⃣ Creating Groups

Groups represent teams handling tickets:

Certificates Group – Manages certificate-related issues.

Platform Group – Manages login issues, 404 errors, and expired accounts.

3️⃣ Creating Roles

Roles define permissions:

Certificate_role – Access to certificate-related tickets.

Platform_role – Access to platform-related tickets.

4️⃣ Creating a Custom Table & Choices

Custom table Operations related with fields: Issue, Description, Assigned To, Status.
Choices for the Issue field:

Unable to login to platform

404 error

Regarding certificates

Regarding user expired

5️⃣ Assigning Users & Roles to Groups

Certificates Group: Katherine Pierce + Certificate_role

Platform Group: Manne Niranjan + Platform_role

6️⃣ Assigning Roles to Table

Both roles granted Read/Write access to the Operations related table.

7️⃣ Creating ACLs

Access Control Lists (ACLs) created for sensitive fields (Issue, Priority, Ticket Raised Date) to restrict access to authorized roles (admin).

8️⃣ Creating Automated Flows

Flow 1: Automatically assign “Regarding Certificates” tickets to the Certificates Group.

Flow 2: Automatically assign Platform-related issues (Login, 404 Error, User Expired) to the Platform Group.

📸 Screenshots

Tickets with “Regarding Certificates” → Automatically routed to Certificates Group.

Tickets with “Unable to login”, “404 Error”, “User Expired” → Automatically routed to Platform Group.

✅ Results

The automated ticket assignment system has:

Reduced delays by eliminating manual routing.

Improved accuracy by ensuring tickets reach the right team.

Optimized workloads across support groups.

Enhanced customer satisfaction with faster resolution times.

📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how ServiceNow automation can transform IT Service Management (ITSM). By minimizing administrative tasks, it allows support teams to focus on solving issues rather than managing ticket distribution.
