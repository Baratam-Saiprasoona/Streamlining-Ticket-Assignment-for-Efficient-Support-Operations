## üõ†Ô∏è Project Implementation  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Users  
Users represent individuals in the system. Two users were created:  
- **Katherine Pierce** ‚Äì Member of the Certificates Group.  
- **Manne Niranjan** ‚Äì Member of the Platform Group.  


---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Groups  
Groups represent teams that handle tickets:  
- **Certificates Group** ‚Äì Manages certificate-related issues.  
- **Platform Group** ‚Äì Handles login issues, 404 errors, and expired accounts.  


---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Roles  
Roles define permissions:  
- **Certificate_role** ‚Äì Grants certificate issue handling access.  
- **Platform_role** ‚Äì Grants platform issue handling access.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Table & Choices  
A custom table **Operations related** was created with fields:  
- Issue, Description, Assigned To, Status.  

Choices for the **Issue** field:  
- Unable to login to platform  
- 404 error  
- Regarding certificates  
- Regarding user expired  


---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Assigning Users & Roles to Groups  
- **Certificates Group:** Katherine Pierce + Certificate_role  
- **Platform Group:** Manne Niranjan + Platform_role  


---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Assigning Roles to Table  
Both **Certificate_role** and **Platform_role** were assigned **Read/Write access** to the *Operations related* table.  


---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Creating ACLs  
Access Control Lists (ACLs) were defined for sensitive fields (Issue, Priority, Ticket Raised Date) to restrict access to authorized roles (admin).  


---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Flows for Ticket Assignment  
- **Flow 1:** Automatically assign *‚ÄúRegarding Certificates‚Äù* tickets to the Certificates Group.  
- **Flow 2:** Automatically assign *Platform-related issues* (Login, 404 Error, User Expired) to the Platform Group.  


---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion  
The **automated ticket assignment system** implemented in ServiceNow has transformed IT support operations at ABC Corporation by:  
- **Reducing delays** with automatic routing.  
- **Improving accuracy** by ensuring tickets reach the right team.  
- **Optimizing efficiency** through balanced workloads.  
- **Enhancing customer satisfaction** with faster resolution.  

This project demonstrates how **ServiceNow automation** streamlines IT Service Management (ITSM) by eliminating manual tasks and enabling teams to focus on resolving issues instead of managing ticket assignments.
